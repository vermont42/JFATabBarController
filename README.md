JFATabBarController
===================

`UITabBarController` is a handy control for building user interfaces, but it has an annoying limitation: if there are more than five tabs, a "More" button replaces the fifth tab. The user might not understand what "More" means or the fact that it hides additional controllers. `JFATabBarController` is a pluggable replacement for `UITabBarController` that eliminates this limitation. The user of this control can access an arbitrary number of controllers simply by swiping left on the tab bar. By default, `JFATabBarController` displays an exciting animation when changing tabs.

For a video of `JFATabBarController` in action, see [here](https://vimeo.com/102583744) or [here](https://vimeo.com/111125796) (includes [music](https://incompetech.com)).

## Installation and Use
To demo `JFATabBarController`, just clone the repository, double-click `JFATabBarController.xcodeproj`, and run on an iPhone or iPad simulator or device.

Here are the steps to use `JFATabBarController` in your app. These instructions assume familiarity with use of `UITabBarController`.

1. Add `JFATabBarController.h`, `JFATabBarController.m`, `JFAArrowView.m`, and `JFAArrowView.h` to your project. Alternatively, add `pod 'JFATabBarController'` to your `Podfile` and do a `pod install`.
2. If you do not already have a `UITabBarController` in your storyboard, add one.
3. Change the class of this `UITabBarController` to `JFATabBarController` by selecting it, opening the Utilities pane, showing the Identity inspector, and changing the class to `JFATabBarController`.
4. If you have not done so already, create a "relationship segue - view controller" from the `JFATabBarController` to each view controller you want accessible from the tab bar.
5. For each view controller accessible from the tab bar, either set the name and image of the tab-bar item or change the identifier to a system item like "Favorites" or "Bookmarks".

## Constants
There are two constants of interest in `JFATabBarController.m`.

`MAX_TAB_COUNT` is the maximum number of tab-bar items to show at once. You are not limited to `UITabBarController`â€™s five.

`TAB_ANIMATION_DURATION` is the duration of the tab-changing animation. The larger the number, the longer the duration. Set this to 0.0 to prevent animation.

## Notes
`JFATabBarController` has been tested on iPhone SE, iPhone X, iPhone ðŸŽ¾, iPhone ðŸŽ¾ Max, iPad XR, and iPad Pro.

Because the app for which `JFATabBarController` was created, [Immigration](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/immigration/id777319358), has no need for `UITabBarController`â€™s localization, badge, or accessibility features, `JFATabBarController` does not currently support them. The app may require these features at some point, and `JFATabBarController` will support them then. Pull requests are welcome.
